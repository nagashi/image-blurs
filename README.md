# The Challenge

Write a class that will create a data representation of an image in the form of a 2 dimensional array of 0’s and 1’s forming the pixels of the image. Then create a blur method that will cause any of the 1’s in the image to change the pixels to the left, right, above and below to also be 1’s. This method will need to accept an argument that will specify how far to apply the blur effect.
